Good afternoon, everyone. I am very glad to present my research today on the Classification of highly divergent protein domain families using deep learning and hierarchical clustering.
My first project is to develop Domain-based Deep Learning Models for Protein Superfamily Prediction.

As we all know, the basic elements of proteins are 20 amino acids. Through their different combinations,  we have millions of protein sequences. Each of them forms a unique structure.  
The different protein superfamilies have unique domain structures and topologies, and they play distinct roles in cellular processes.
The classification of proteins can help us understand the function and evolution of proteins.
The profiles collected from MSA, such as PSSM, and contact maps from the structure information are usually used to identify the superfamily. However, it is tailored to the individual family, and it isn't easy to recognize previously undefined families. 

Many established models played a crucial role in protein families/superfamilies representation, such as MSA, Consensus sequences, Pattern matching, and Sequence motifs.
Additionally, Profile models exhibit better performance in the comprehensive representation of protein features, such as the PSSM generated by PSI-BLAST and the HMM generated by HMMER. They can be used to explore the evolutionary information.
However, they all have some limitations. First, the models are tailored to the individual family. It doesn’t work for uncovered families. Second, it is challenging to detect highly divergent sequences using existing methods. Besides, detecting novel proteins remains a significant challenge.

Therefore, we aim to make an AI model to predict protein superfamilies.  Given a structure, we hope it can inform us about the superfamily to which it belongs.
When we were babies, our family taught us everything we needed to know in life. For example, the cat-dog recognition issues. They would tell us, 'This is a dog, that is a cat, this is another type of dog.' Then we could know what it is. That’s the Human brain's intelligence.
Recently, Artificial intelligence has been widely used in our lives, such as FaceID and ChatGPT.
AI encompasses various methods, and deep learning is one of the most significant AI approaches, which involves processing data through multiple layers of computation. It looks like the human brain's neural structure. 
AI was very popular in many fields,  especially Biology.  CNN has a great performance in image recognition, and Bi-LSTM has better performance in capturing sequential information. 

In bioinformatics, numerous well-known AI models are available. Recently.  PsiPred can predict secondary protein structures with a neural network. Given a sequence, alphafold can predict the 3D structure of proteins with high accuracy. Due to the groundbreaking work, the creator of AlphaFold received the Nobel Prize last year. 

In section 1 of my first project. We aim to develop a domain-based deep learning model to represent the protein families and superfamilies.
As we know, PSSM can present the evolutionary information of the proteins. We aim to investigate whether PSSM can be utilized to make predictions for protein superfamilies. 
Another point is why I want to create a domain-based model. A protein's complete function depends on the combination of different domains. Each domain has its specific function.
For a protein with multiple domains, annotating a protein with a single function is not ideal. 
The full-length-based model will mislead in the study of protein evolution.

Our workflow contains three main steps. For data preparation, we used the PSI-BLAST to generate the pssm and then unified the dimensions. Additionally, data splitting involves randomly dividing the data into three sets: training data, a validation set, and a testing set. 
During model training, we attempted to create different LSTM structure models because a part of the PSSM is meaningless.  LSTM can also capture global information from the PSSM.

Here, we consider the superfamily BECR as an example.  BECR is one of the largest protein superfamilies with an assemblage of metal-independent RNases.
Representative members of BECR --> Barnase, EndoU, Colicin E5/D, and RelE. 

For each family, 10 - 15 representative sequences were randomly selected to generate PSSM profiles.
Number of profiles: 6984 (belong to 45 BECR super-families and 399 other super-families).
80% --> Training data; 10% --> Validation data; 10%--> Testing data.

Each time of training, we can calculate the True positive, False positive, False Negative, and True Negative, given the prediction results. The Evaluation indicators, Including Recall, Precision, Accuracy, and F1 score, can be used to evaluate the model's performance.  

In the final model, we found that when the epoch exceeds 30, the Evaluation indicators become stable.

Finally, we obtained a model with an accuracy of 96% on the testing data.

We want to test the robustness of the model with three independent families. And the accuracy is 67%.

In Section 2. We want to create a structure-based model.
As we are all aware, different proteins have different structures. The function of proteins depends on their structure.
With AlphaFold, we can predict the structure from sequences.   However, 3D information is not easily readable by a computer.  A contact map is a 2D representation of the 3D structure. 
Someone can identify the superfamily type after training with many contact maps, but it is not easy. “Recognizing the contact map is kind of like the cat-dog recognition problem.”
Input the kcontact map into the CNN model, and after multiple convolutional layers, it can output the category of the superfamily.

Before inputting the CNN, we need to perform a matrix transformation due to the outliers. Gaussian functions can smoothly transform the distance to probability with range (0,1], especially when there are some outliers.
1. Our model has a good performance with an accuracy of 97% on testing data.
2. Three families were used to make a test as independent data, and the accuracy rate is  66%.

In Section 3. We aim to develop a model that incorporates both evolutionary and structural information. However,  a big challenge is how to merge two datasets.
As we know, a colorful picture can be represented by three channels: the red channel, the green channel, and the blue channel.  We can therefore place PSSM and the contact map in two channels. However, PSSM and contact map have different dimensions. A contact map is a self-self distance matrix, and the dimension is LxL. PSSM refers to the specific scores for the target 20 amino acids, with a dimension of L x 20. If we can convert the PSSM to a square matrix, then it can continue with the channels. 

Here, we use the cosine similarity transformation to convert the PSSM to a square matrix. By comparing the similarity of different amino acids in 20 vectors, we can get the cosine similarity of amino acids in a protein.

The workflow is as follows. We generate two-channel datasets with a Structure generated by AlphaFold and a PSSM generated by PSI-BLAST. After training with multiple layers, it can report to us the superfamily type.

1. Our model has a good performance with an accuracy of 99% on testing data.
2. Three families were used to make a test as independent data, and the accuracy rate is  86%.
In brief, we developed two models: a profile-based deep learning model and a profile-structure-based deep learning model, specifically tailored for the BECR family.
1. 1. The accuracy of the three kinds of domain-based deep learning models with testing data is about 98%. The domain-based deep learning model achieves its best accuracy with independent data, at 86%.
2. 2. The model combined with PSSM and Contact map has the best performance in all three models. 
=========================================================================Project 2?Hierarchical clustering of highly divergent proteins
Protein classification helps establish sequence-function relationships.
Traditional phylogenetic approaches are effective for similar sequence families but struggle with highly divergent families.

1. With Alphafold, we can predict many structures. 
2. DALI comparison of contact maps to evaluate structural similarity.
3. Conversion of similarity scores into divergence scores.
4. hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA)
